# Day 22 - Semantic HTML Blog Layout  

## 📌 Topic  
Today’s practice was focused on **Semantic HTML** elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).  

I built a **Blog Layout** using these semantic tags to structure the content clearly and meaningfully.  

## 📝 What I Learned  
- How to use **semantic elements** to improve accessibility & SEO  
- Structuring a webpage with **header, nav, main, article, section, aside, footer**  
- Creating a **blog-style layout** with posts and a sidebar  
- Writing **clean and meaningful HTML**
